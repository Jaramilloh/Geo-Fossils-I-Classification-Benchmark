## Architectures

The following architectures were implemented with a classification head for the specific task:

* ResNet50
* InceptionV3
* Visual Transformer (b_16)
* Visual Transformer (b_32)

Each network were initialized with trained weights from the ImageNet [2] classification task, and each backbone is freezed, thus only applying gradient descent to the classification layer.


## Data Augmentation

In order to enhance the learning distribution space, the following data augmentation techniques were applied randomly for the images:

* Random resized crop.
* Random rotation.
* Color jitter.
* Random horizontal flip.
* Center crop.
* Standarization with  mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
